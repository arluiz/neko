# Neko Project

Neko is a Java framework for constructing distributed algorithms. Processes interact using message
passing. It is highly extensible, yet simple and easy to use. Algorithms can be either simulated or
executed on a real network; the same Java code is used in both cases. A variety of simulated and
real networks are supported, and a library of fault tolerance algorithms has been implemented.

Neko was written at the Distributed Systems Lab of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in
Lausanne (EPFL), by Xavier Défago and Péter Urbán, as well as some students. Since the source page is not available anymore, this repository aims to provide access to neko source code.

The permission to use, modify, merge the Software, in whole or in part, for research activities of any kind
is granted with the additional condition that one of the following papers is referenced when publishing the
results:
